As per the examples given, 

- all food is assumed to be chocolate, 
- all medicine is assumed to be pill(s),
- all book descriptions have to have the word book somewhere. 
- An item whose name/description does not contain chocolate, food, pill is
not exempted from basic sales tax.
- the price specified is for each item. "1 chocolate bar at 0.85" would mean that one chocolate bar
was bought at 85 cents and "2 chocolate bars at 0.85", would mean that 2 chocolate bars were bought each at 85 cents
- For an item to be an import, it has to have `import` with in its description.
- We are dealing with small numbers so differences due to using the
  BigDecimal class for floats should be negligible.
